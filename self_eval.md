# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
# I was totally underwater on this exercise but pulled through.  I learned by researching and just continueing to work.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
# The methods are important when we have multiple different items we are running code for.  Like the last exercise in the "final_practice.rb" file, we had to check stock on various items, so we just needed one method to check the stock and tell us what is needed.
